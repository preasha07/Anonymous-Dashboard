# **ANONYMOUS DIGITAL DASHBOARD**

Welcome to the Anonymous Digital Dashboard! This interactive web application is designed to streamline your data analysis by allowing you to drag and drop CSV files and instantly visualize your business metrics. With powerful features and intuitive design, you can gain actionable insights with ease.


## Features
- **Drag and Drop CSV Upload:** Effortlessly upload your Monthly Job Sheet, Client Sheet, and Salary Sheet to generate a dynamic dashboard.
- **Template Downloads:** Access pre-formatted templates to ensure your data is correctly structured for smooth integration and analysis.
- **Insightful Graphs:** Visualize key metrics with interactive graphs that highlight crucial insights into profits and time spent on clients.
- **Multi-Select Analysis:** Utilize a multi-choice drop-down menu to selectively analyze specific clients, providing focused and detailed data insights.
- **Profit and Time Metrics:**
  1. Profit per Client: Quickly determine the profit generated by each client.
  2.  Time Spent per Client: View the time invested in each client in both minutes and hours.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    1. Total Time Spent
    2.  Total Profit
    3.  Money Earned per Minute
- **Customizable Views:** Tailor your analysis by selecting specific data points and metrics that are most relevant to your business needs.


## Technolgies Used In The Project :

   - `Jupyter Notebook` : Utilized for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data preprocessing using **pandas** and **numpy**.

   - `Streamlit Framework` :  The web application is built with **Streamlit**, offering a user-friendly and interactive interface.

   `Plotly` : Employed for creating the interactive graphs, providing dynamic and insightful visualizations.


## Overview

The Super Mario Bros Reinforcement Learning project presents an in-depth, multi-faceted learning opportunity. It skillfully blends theoretical comprehension with practical application. This project goes beyond just grasping concepts- it's about employing those concepts in real-life situations. It serves as an ideal stage for refining skills with broad applications in the fast-growing realms of AI and ML. By engaging in this project, participants can immerse themselves in these intricate subjects and gain a distinctive combination of knowledge and hands-on skills invaluable in today's world.

## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
poetry update
python main.py
```

This should start a terminal session which will show all values for during training. It will also spawn a game window in which one can see the agent playing Mario throughout the different sessions
